# Dependenceasy
Easy way to manage javascript dependencies.

Goal :
 - only github url dependecies
 - version or branch
 - git clone to install dependecy (to be able to develop inside the installed dependecies)
 - multiples files for differents environnements (depencies.prod.json, depencies.dev.json, etc.)
 - recurcive dependency management (for later)
